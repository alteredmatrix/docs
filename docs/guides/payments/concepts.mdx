## Payment statuses

Because each payment can include multiple transactions, statuses are assigned to transactions.

| Status | Explanation |
| ------ | ------ |
| `upcoming` | Initiated transactions that aren't authorized yet |
| `pending` | Authorized transactions that aren't recorded yet |
| `released` | Card transactions with expired authorization, so the un-debited balance returns to the available account balance |
| `booked` | Completed and recorded debit or credit transactions |
| `canceled` | Transactions canceled by any party |
| `rejected` | Transactions rejected for any reason, the most common being insufficient funds |

### Payment status regulations

There are regulations about transaction statuses.

Swan's Web Banking interface complies with all regulations.
If you develop your own interface, pay close attention to these regulations.

#### On behalf of individual users

Acting on behalf of individual users requires a user access token*[tkq-link]* or user impersonation*[tkq-link]*.

For you to view an account's transaction history, the EU Revised Directed on Payment Services (PSD2) requires Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)*[tkq-link]* from the user*[tkq-account holder/member?]* if they haven't performed a SCA in the preceding 90 days.

After they provide consent from their mobile device, they're redirected to the callback URL.
You can retrieve the `consentId` in the query `params`*[tkq-link]*.
Call this query anytime to retrieve an account's transaction history.

#### On your own behalf (server-to-server)

Acting on your own behalf requires a project access token*[tkq-link]*.

PSD2 does not require SCA for you to view your own transaction history.
If you need to provide information to an individual user, however, the 90-day SCA rule applies.
